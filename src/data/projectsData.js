    text: "Among its cobblestone streets and beautiful tile façade buildings, Bairro Alto is one of the coolest areas in Lisbon. From art galleries, to alternative cafes, local stores, and rooftop bars for a stunning sunset view - this neighbourhood is one of the most diverse districts. It is no coincidence that Selina chose this location to provide the type of stimulating cultural experience its guests are looking for. With the collaboration of João Samina, Low Class Club, Frederico Draw and Contra. When asked to transform Doorm, a building designed by the architect Tiago Reberlo de Andrade, into a Selina oasis in between Bairro Alto’s narrow streets, we envisioned recreating a small piece of everything that happens in the neighbourhood. Creating the perfect symbiosis between day- and nightlife while adding a little bit of Selina’s wild essence.",

    text: "With the ocean as a backdrop, Selina Paros hotel is a beach house with large common areas that promotes conviviality and attracts especially digital nomads who can enjoy the perfect combination of wellness and water sports, without losing the traditional essence of Greek architecture and customs. Selina Paros represents the perfect symbiosis between tradition and elegance while preserving the building’s original finishes and drawing a sophisticated atmosphere through decorative elements and furniture pieces. A rather distinct formal composition that appears as a contrast in the environments of neutral and calm tones. This is the preliminary phase of refurbishing a set of traditional Greek flats, with an expected completion in February 2022.",

    text: "Selina Navis is a coworking space in Porto, which invites local entrepreneurs, start-ups and digital nomads alike to network, learn and grow. Inspired by the past but working and playing in the future through dynamic and electrifying spaces. The building's layout is divided into several shared workstations but offers as well lots of private spaces for meetings and conference calls. An inspiring environment that seeks to transmit dynamism and contemporaneity through a contrasting chromatic palette and decorative notes. The collaboration with local artists such as André da Loba, MOTE, Contra and Andy Calabozo is another highlight where we were able to integrate the Selina spirit into a heritage building and makes this coworking space the perfect collision of past and present.",

    text: "Just 30 minutes away from Portugal's buzzing capital, the village of Ericeira offers a little paradise for surfers and nature lovers alike. Selina Ericeira hotel translates exactly this spirit through the application of natural materials like wood and rattan in the finishings, while a relaxed and fresh furniture brings the balance between the rustic and young spirit. Being a family house transformed into a hotel, the spatial organization of the building’s interior was thought to transmit the feeling of home. It’s composed of a living room, a kitchen and the bedrooms - just as if it was a family residence. We kept the original layout of the kitchen and living room area and converted it into a restaurant where you can have a meal as if you were at home. All furniture was built from old appliances and doors reused through a workshop with the help of young creative carpenters.",
